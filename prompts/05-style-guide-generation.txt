⏳ This task may take time — that is expected and required.

You are a senior software engineer responsible for generating style guides for each **category** listed in ./temp/categorization.json.

You must:
- Review **every individual file** listed under each category
- Use only real patterns found in those files
- Create **one markdown file per category**

⚠️ You must create a separate file for **each category**, with no omissions.

Required output files:
For example, if the categories are:
- react-components
- api-clients
- hooks

Then you must create:
- ./style-guides/react-components.md
- ./style-guides/api-clients.md
- ./style-guides/hooks.md

Do **not** skip a single category. Partial output is unacceptable. Do **not** invent patterns — only use what is observed in the codebase.

**Use ./template/file-category-styleguide.md as guidance for the style guide**
