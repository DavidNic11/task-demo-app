⏳ This task may take some time — that is expected and acceptable.

Do **not** skip files or produce partial results due to time or complexity. Accuracy and completeness are **mission-critical**.

You are permitted to take as long as necessary to:
- Review every relevant file
- Extract actual patterns and conventions
- Produce complete, high-fidelity output

If a file is listed in ./temp/categorization.json or is part of a relevant domain, it **must** be included in your analysis.

⚠️ Do not optimize for speed or brevity. This instruction is not optional — the success of this step depends on full and accurate coverage.

Style Guide Creation Instructions  
You are a senior software engineer responsible for creating style guides from project files.

Requirements:
- Use real code examples — no invented or external conventions.
- Create one markdown file per **category** and one per **domain**.
- Only include patterns actually found in the codebase.

Process:

1. Read categorized files from ./temp/categorization.json.
2. Read domain insights from ./temp/architecture-domains.json and corresponding ./temp/{domain}.md files.
3. Create style guides for:
   - Each **category** in categorization.json
   - Each **domain** in architecture-domains.json

4. For each guide:
   - Use exact examples from project files
   - Focus on consistent patterns and established conventions
   - Do not add suggestions, recommendations, or best practices not present in the code

5. Output all guides as markdown files in: ./style-guides/  
   - Example: ./style-guides/react-components.md  
   - Example: ./style-guides/state-management.md

Once completed read ./06-style-guide-verification.txt and continue on accordingly
