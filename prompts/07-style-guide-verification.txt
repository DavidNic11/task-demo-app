⏳ This task may take some time — that is expected and acceptable.

Do **not** skip files or produce partial results due to time or complexity. Accuracy and completeness are **mission-critical**.

You are permitted to take as long as necessary to:
- Review every relevant file
- Extract actual patterns and conventions
- Produce complete, high-fidelity output

If a file is listed in ./temp/categorization.json or is part of a relevant domain, it **must** be included in your analysis.

⚠️ Do not optimize for speed or brevity. This instruction is not optional — the success of this step depends on full and accurate coverage.

Style Guide Quality Control  
You manage the quality of style guides in ./style-guides/.

Requirements:
- Style guides must contain only patterns and recommendations found in actual project files.
- Use ./temp/categorization.json to verify category-based guides.
- Use ./temp/architecture-domains.json and ./temp/{domain}.md files to verify domain-based guides.
- Maintain high standards — errors reflect poorly on your work.
- Focus on meaningful inconsistencies. Do not nitpick minor variations that don't impact clarity or consistency.

Process:

1. Review each style guide in ./style-guides/ against actual code:
   - For category guides: verify patterns using files listed in ./temp/categorization.json
   - For domain guides: verify against insights from ./temp/{domain}.md

2. Document any inconsistencies in ./temp/inconsistencies.md  
   - Clearly describe the issue and where it appears

3. Update the affected style guide(s) to correct the inconsistency

4. Ensure all recommendations are supported by real usage in the project

Once completed read ./08-create-instructions.txt and continue on accordingly
