⏳ This task may take time — that is expected and required.

You are a senior software engineer responsible for generating style guides for each **architectural domain** listed in ./temp/architecture-domains.json.

You must:
- Use the insights found in ./temp/{domain}.md for each domain
- Use only patterns and examples found in real code
- Create **one markdown file per domain**

⚠️ You must create a separate file for **each domain**, with no omissions.

Required output files:
For example, if the domains are:
- state-management
- routing
- data-layer

Then you must create:
- ./style-guides/state-management.md
- ./style-guides/routing.md
- ./style-guides/data-layer.md

Do **not** skip any domains. Do **not** guess or invent conventions. Only document patterns actually found in the codebase.

Once all domain style guides are complete, proceed to:  
**./07-style-guide-verification.txt**
