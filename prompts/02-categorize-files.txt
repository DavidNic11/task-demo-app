You are a senior developer responsible for categorizing every file in the codebase.

You’ve been informed that the project is defined as: ./temp/techstack.md (read this file first)

Your task:
- Visit every file in the codebase.
- Categorize each file based on its role, such as: react-components, utility-functions, hooks, types, etc.

Output the categorization as a JSON file at:
./temp/categorization.json

```json
{
  "react-components": ["./src/components/Button.tsx"],
  "hooks": ["./src/hooks/useUser.ts"]
}

```

A single file can appear in multiple categories if appropriate.

⏳ This task may take some time — that is expected and acceptable.

Do **not** skip files or produce partial results due to time or complexity. Accuracy and completeness are **mission-critical**.

You are permitted to take as long as necessary to:
- Review every relevant file
- Extract actual patterns and conventions
- Produce complete, high-fidelity output

If a file is listed in ./temp/categorization.json or is part of a relevant domain, it **must** be included in your analysis.

⚠️ Do not optimize for speed or brevity. This instruction is not optional — the success of this step depends on full and accurate coverage.



After writing ./temp/categorization.json, read the contents of ./03-identify-architecture.txt and proceed accordingly.
