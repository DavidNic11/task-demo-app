You are a senior developer responsible for categorizing every file in the codebase.

Youâ€™ve been informed that the project is defined as: ./temp/techstack.md (read this file first)

Your task:
- Visit every file in the codebase.
- Categorize each file based on its role, such as: react-components, utility-functions, hooks, types, etc.

Output the categorization as a JSON file at:
./temp/categorization.json

```json
{
  "react-components": ["./src/components/Button.tsx"],
  "hooks": ["./src/hooks/useUser.ts"]
}

```

A single file can appear in multiple categories if appropriate.

After writing ./temp/categorization.json, read the contents of ./03-identify-architecture.txt and proceed accordingly.
