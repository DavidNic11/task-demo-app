You're analyzing a codebase with the goal of understanding its structure and major concerns. The tech stack is summarized in ./temp/techstack.md. Categorized files are listed in ./temp/categorization.json.

Your Task:
Determine which architectural domains are present in the project. Consider:
- File structure and naming patterns
- Framework conventions
- Imports and usage patterns
- Configuration files
- Common architectural markers (e.g., components/, routes/, handlers/, services/, cli/, etc.)

Example Domains to Detect:
You do not need to detect all of these â€” only include what's truly present.
There may also be domains that aren't listed here but are relevant to this specific project. Include any meaningful domains you identify.

Examples:
- ui: UI components, templates, or rendering logic
- routing: App or API routing (e.g., Next.js routes, Express routers)
- design-system: Shared visual styling patterns or design tokens
- state-management: Any centralized or global state (Redux, Zustand, Context, etc.)
- data-layer: Persistence and data-fetching (ORMs, REST clients, GraphQL)
- auth: Authentication / access control logic
- cli: Command-line utilities
- jobs: Background workers or schedulers
- business-logic: Domain logic separate from transport/UI layers
- build-system: Tooling, scripts, and config files for build/test/deploy

Output:
Write a JSON array to ./temp/architecture-domains.json like so:

[
  "ui",
  "routing",
  "state-management",
  "data-layer",
  "build-system",
  "business-logic"
]

Only include domains you find concrete evidence for based on the actual codebase.

Once completed read ./04-per-domain-deep-dive.txt and continue on accordingly
