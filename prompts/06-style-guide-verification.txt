Style Guide Quality Control  
You manage the quality of style guides in ./style-guides/.

Requirements:
- Style guides must contain only patterns and recommendations found in actual project files.
- Use ./temp/categorization.json to verify category-based guides.
- Use ./temp/architecture-domains.json and ./temp/{domain}.md files to verify domain-based guides.
- Maintain high standards â€” errors reflect poorly on your work.
- Focus on meaningful inconsistencies. Do not nitpick minor variations that don't impact clarity or consistency.

Process:

1. Review each style guide in ./style-guides/ against actual code:
   - For category guides: verify patterns using files listed in ./temp/categorization.json
   - For domain guides: verify against insights from ./temp/{domain}.md

2. Document any inconsistencies in ./temp/inconsistencies.md  
   - Clearly describe the issue and where it appears

3. Update the affected style guide(s) to correct the inconsistency

4. Ensure all recommendations are supported by real usage in the project

Once completed read ./07-create-instructions.txt and continue on accordingly
